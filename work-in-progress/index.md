## How to provide feedback for RC-0
Note, feedback for RC-0 closes on 2022-05-14.

Please make use of the two week feedback window for RC-0 by either:
- Filing issues on the [specification repository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues), making it clear the issue relates to 2020-12-patch-1-RC-0
- Discuss in the [#specification channel on our Slack server](https://json-schema.slack.com/archives/CT7FF623C) - You will need to join if you haven't already

**Please note, only feedback relating specifically to the changes found in the above diff are useful. This release is not making functional changes.**

The previous `draft 2020-12` specification documents will become obsolete, as did draft-07 specification documents when they were patched.

If you have suggestions for changes to the specification in general, we invite you to open a [Discussion on our GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/discussions) and/or chat with us in the #general or #specificaiton channels on our [Slack server](/slack).
