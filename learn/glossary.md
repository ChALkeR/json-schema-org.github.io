# JSON Schema Glossary

This document collects short explanations of terminology one may encounter within the JSON Schema community.

Whilst many of the entries below have precise technical definitions, preference is given to explanations of their conversational use, with additional references linked for further information.
This page is not meant to be [normative](#normative), nor is it meant to contain fully original research or explanation.
It is meant to aid the understanding of those less familiar with formal language used within JSON Schema, or within specifications more broadly.
(In fact, entries below make effort to avoid terminology like "normative" itself for reasons just mentioned.)

The entries on this page can be linked to via anchor links (e.g. `https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary.html#vocabulary`) when sharing a definition with others.

### draft

An individual release of the JSON Schema specification.

JSON Schema drafts are not intended to be provisional documents, as the layman's use of the word "draft" might indicate.

While future drafts may introduce new behavior or changes to existing behavior, each draft is a completed, released document, batching together changes to the specification, and intended for implementation and use.

The current list of drafts can be found [here](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#published-drafts).

### normative

In the context of JSON Schema, and formal specifications more broadly, a document which outlines standardized behavior.
This is as distinct from *non*-normative or informational documents, meant to explain, simplify or offer opinions.

Distinguishing between whether a document is normative or not is intended to clarify to those using the document whether its contents are allowed to contradict or augment behavior described in other normative documents.
JSON Schema's normative documents notably include its [specification](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
This page for instance, not being a normative document, is not able to proscribe new JSON Schema behavior not already covered by the specification.
